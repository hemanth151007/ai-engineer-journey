# My AI Engineer Journey

This repository is a public log of my 18-month journey to becoming a proficient AI Engineer. My goal is to build a deep, fundamental understanding of computer science, machine learning, and production systems.

## The Plan
I am following a structured, day-by-day plan covering:
- Programming Fundamentals (Python, C++)
- Mathematics (Linear Algebra, Calculus, Probability)
- Machine Learning & Deep Learning
- Systems Design & MLOps

## Today's Progress - Day 1
*   Started the journey!
*   Set up this GitHub repository to track my progress publicly.
*   Completed Day 1 of Python basics (variables, data types).

## Goals
*   **Short-Term:** Build consistent daily coding habits.
*   **Long-Term:** Contribute to meaningful open-source AI projects and become a professional in the field.
